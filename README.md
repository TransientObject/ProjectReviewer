VideoBook
=========

A Ruby on Rails application to judge videos online

There are several criterias with which judges can rate a particular project video

Judges can view top video based on categories

Admins will be able to manage the judging criteria

End users (in this case, students) will be able to upload the videos and set a category in which the video shall be judged
